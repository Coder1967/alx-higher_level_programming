test file for function which divides a  matrix(2d array)
========================================================

>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

>>> matrix_divided([[4,8, 2], [6, 10, 18]], 4)
[[1.0, 2.0, 0.5], [1.5, 2.5, 4.5]]

testing for when 0 is passed as the divisor
>>> matrix_divided([[6, 7, 5], [54, 76, 5]], 0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

testing for when a string is passed as the divisor
>>> matrix_divided([[6, 7, 5], [54, 76, 5]], "hello")
Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
TypeError: div must be a number

testing for when a marix with uneven rows is passed
>>> matrix_divided([[4,8], [6, 10, 18]], 4)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

testing for when a matrix of strings is passed
>>> matrix_divided([["good", "day"], ["hello" "man"]], 6)
Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

testing for when a 1d list is passed instead of a matrix
>>> matrix_divided([7, 4, 6], 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
